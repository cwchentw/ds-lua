# ds-lua

Data Science in Lua.

## Introduction

This module demonstrates common algoritms in data science, including
statistics and data mining, in Lua.  Since Lua is a slow language compared
with C/C++, you should not rely on this module for critical tasks.  In
addition, this module is still in alpha stage; the API may change without warning.

Lua community is split by two major Lua implementations, official [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
and [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/). Although LuaJIT is behind official Lua in
language features, the former outperforms the latter by about 10x-50x.  Therefore,
this library targets LuaJIT.

## Install

Pending.

## Documentation
